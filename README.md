Tools to **expose CMake packages/projects to Build2 build system**.

 - Build2: https://build2.org
 - CMake: https://cmake.org

The main objective here is to be able to use CMake packages and projects from a Build2 project.

**BEWARE: this is a proof-of-concept, it's not destined to be used in production.**

Special Thanks to @blastrock (Philippe Daouadi) for the help figuring out issues with the cmake export stuffs in the tests.
