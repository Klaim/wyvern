# libwyvern

C++ library

This is a prototype, don't use this.

## Testing

For now, you need to launch `b test` from the root directory of the repository for the tests to find the test cmake project (in `./tests/test_cmake_project/`).
This could be fixed using `testscript` though I lack time to do it properly.
